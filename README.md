**CELESTYUM®** is an electronic music and digital art festival platform built for immersive, high-performance web experiences.

This repository contains the **official web application** for CELESTYUM, designed as a fullscreen, scroll-based experience with real-time visuals, 3D assets, and modern UI primitives.

## Overview

CELESTYUM is conceived as a next-generation festival experience combining:
